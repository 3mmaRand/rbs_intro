## Why R? 

* Open source and free
--
.......But so is Python
  
--

* R caters to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into programming  

![biologists](pics/biologist1.png)
--

* Language for data analysis and graphics  

--

* Community - welcoming, inclusive.  
  [RForwards](https://forwards.github.io/)  
  [RLadies](https://rladies.org/)
  
--

* R Markdown  
  R's "killer feature"  .......Super-charged reproducibility!

# Typing in data, calcs, plots
## The goal
We will work some data on the number of males in 64 bird nests with a clutch size of 5.
--
.pull-left[
You are going to make this data, find the mean number of males per nest...
```{r , echo=FALSE}
n <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
freq <- c(4, 13, 14, 15, 13, 5)
df <- data.frame(n, freq)
knitr::kable(df, 
             format = "html",
             col.names = c("No. males", "No. nests"),
             row.names = FALSE)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
... and plot it


```{r , echo=FALSE,fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
barplot(freq, 
        names.arg = n,
        xlab = "Number of males",
        ylab = "Number of nests")
```
]


---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Getting set up

In Windows explorer, make yourself a folder for this work.  

--

<mark style="background-color: #e6f0ff">Make a note of it!</mark>

--

In RStudio, [set your working directory](pics/menusetwd.png) to the folder you created above.  

--

Make a [new script](pics/newscript.png) file called RBS_am.R to carry out the rest of the work.  

---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Putting the data into R data structures

Make a vector `n` that holds the numbers 0 to 5. 
```{r}
# the number of males in a clutch of five
n <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

* Write your command in the script file  
* Notice I have used a comment  
--

* Make sure you have your cursor on the line you want to execute  
* Run it using the ![Run](pics/runbutton.png) button or doing Ctrl+Enter<sup>1</sup>. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

<small>[1] Ctrl+Enter is the default shortcut to run the current line or selection. I prefer to set to Ctrl+R</small>
---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Putting the data into R data structures

Let's take a look at it using `str()` (structure) and `class()`<sup>1</sup>:

```{r}
class(n)
str(n)
```
It's a numeric vector []

&nbsp;  

<small>[1] These commands are useful to check what data type you're working with</small>

---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Putting the data into R data structures

Now create a vector called `freq` containing the numbers of nests with 0 to 5 males. 

```{r}
# the number of nests with 0 to 5 males
freq <- c(4, 13, 14, 15, 13, 5)
```
--
We can use `sum(freq)` to check we get the total number of nests expected, 64

```{r}
# the total number of nests
sum(freq)
```

---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Finding the mean
Our data is in the form of a frequency table so to find the mean number of males per nest we need find the total number of males like this:
.pull-left[
```{r , echo=FALSE}
df$product <- df$n * df$freq
totalm <- sum(df$product)
totaln <- sum(df$freq)
dfchar <- df %>%
  mutate_all(as.character)
dfchar <- rbind(dfchar, c("Total", totaln, totalm))
dfchar %>% kable(format = "html",
                 col.names = c("No. males", "No. nests", "No. males *No. nests"),
                 row.names = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(6, hline_after = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(7, bold = TRUE, background = "#C0C2C9")
```
]

.pull-right[

$$\frac{163}{64} = 2.55$$
]

---
# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Finding the mean

.pull-left[
Find the total number of nests
```{r}
# total number of nests
total_nests <- sum(freq)
```
 

Find the total number of males
```{r}
# total number of males
total_males <- sum(n * freq)
```
 

Find the mean number of males per nest
```{r}
# mean number males/nest
total_males/total_nests
```
]

--

.pull-right[

R works 'elementwise' unlike most programming lanaguges.  
` n * freq`
gives

$$\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\2\\3\\4\\5\end{bmatrix}\times\begin{bmatrix}4\\13\\14\\15\\13\\5\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\13\\28\\45\\52\\25\end{bmatrix}$$

It was designed to make it easy to work with data.

# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Plotting
.pull-left[
Now for our first figure using the base<sup>1</sup> plotting function `barplot()`.  

Making default figures is often easy - useful if you just want to quickly explore your data.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
<small>[1] the 'base' plotting system is part of the base distribution, _i.e.,_ all the packages that come with the basic installation of R.</small>
]

--

.pull-right[
Create simple barplot like this:

```{r fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
barplot(freq)
```

]
---
# Using the help manual

The default barplot doesn't have:
* labels to say what each bar represents  
* axis labels

'Arguments' can be added to the `barplot()` command.  

Commands do something with/to an object and their arguments specify:
* what object to do it to  
* how exactly to do it  

Many commands have defaults so you need only supply an object.

--

Open the manual page using:
```{r eval=FALSE}
?barplot
```

---
# Using the help manual

## Key points

* **Description** an overview of what the command does  

* **Usage** lists argument    
  * format: argument name = default value  
  * some arguments MUST be supplied, they have no defaults
  * ... essentially, etc

* **Arguments** gives the detail on how the arguments work

* **Details** decribes how the command works in more detial  

* **Value** gives the output of the command 

* Don't be too perturbed by not fully understanding the information

# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Plotting
.pull-left[

```{r fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
barplot(freq, names.arg = n)
```
]


--
.pull-right[
We can add names using the `names.arg` argument.

The names of the bars are the numbers of males in a nest. These are in our variable `n`

Arguments are separted by commas 

`command(argument1, argument2, argument3, ...)`

**Top Tip** 

Make your code easier to read by using white space and new lines
* put spaces around `=` , `->` and after `,`
* use a newline after every comma in a command with lots of arguments

        ylab = "Number of nests")
```
]

---

# Plotting - extra challenges

.pull-left[
Make all the bars red.

Colours can be given by their name: "red" 

Or by their hexadecimal code: "#FF3030".  

You can look these up as follows:  

[By colour name](pics/colournames.pdf)

[By hexadecimal code](pics/colourhex.pdf)

        ylab = "Number of nests",
        col = "#FF3030")
```
]
---
# Plotting - extra challenges

.pull-left[
Make the bars alternating red, blue, and yellow. 

To solve this you will need to put together the concept of setting an argument with the concept of collecting several things together to make one thing.

]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ,fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
barplot(freq, 
        names.arg = n,

# Typing in data, calcs, plots

## Plotting using `ggplot2`

The `barplot()` command is part the 'base' plotting system. Base packages (collections of commands) always come with R. 

--

Other packages, such as [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)<sup>1</sup> need to be added ('installed').

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

<small>[1] A fantastic plotting system which has a common conceptual framework for visualisation based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1477928463&sr=8-1&keywords=the+grammar+of+graphics&linkCode=sl1&tag=ggplot2-20&linkId=f0130e557161b83fbe97ba0e9175c431)</small>
---
# Packages

## Installing - you only do once

I recommend installing all of the `tidyverse` packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
--

## Loading - you do once each R session

To use a package which has already been installed you need to 'add it to your library' with the `library()` command.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
`tidyverse` includes `ggplot2` as well as `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions from which we will also use.

---

background-image: url(pics/ggplot.jpg)
background-position: 95% 5%
background-size: 100px

# Plotting using `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is the name of the package

`ggplot()` is its most important command

Using `ggplot2` might seem more complex than the base plotting system at first. 

However, graphs only need to get very slightly more involved for it to become much easier to use.

--

`barplot()` needs a vector of bar heights

`ggplot()` needs a dataframe
---

background-image: url(pics/ggplot.jpg)
background-position: 95% 5%
background-size: 100px

# Plotting using `ggplot2`

First, make sure you have a dataframe.

We need to make one from `n` and `freq`

```{r}
nest_data <- data.frame(n, freq)
```

--
And check
```{r}
str(nest_data)
```

--

`nest_data` is just a name we have given the dataframe

Click on `nest_data` in the Environment pane to see a spreadsheet-like view of it.

---
background-image: url(pics/ggplot.jpg)
background-position: 95% 5%
background-size: 100px

# Plotting using `ggplot2`

Create a simple barplot using `ggplot` like this:

```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=4,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nest_data, aes(x = n, y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

.pull-left[
```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nest_data, aes(x = n, y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```
]

--

.pull-right[
`ggplot()` alone creates a blank plot. 

`ggplot(data = nest_data)` looks the same. 

`aes()` gives the 'Aesthetic mappings'. How variables (columns) are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) e.g., axes, colour, shapes.

`ggplot(data = nest_data, aes(x = n, y = freq))` produces a plot with axes 

`geom_bar` A 'Geom' (Geometric object) gives the visual representations of the data: points, lines, bars, boxplots etc.

]

---
background-image: url(pics/ggplot.jpg)
background-position: 95% 5%
background-size: 100px

# Plotting using `ggplot2`

You can add an axis label like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nest_data, aes(x = n, y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Number of males")

```
.pull-left[
```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = nest_data, aes(x = n, y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Number of males")

```
]
.pull-right[
Each 'layer' is added to the `ggplot()` command with a '+'

# Working with Data: single variable 
## Importing

**The Data**

Measurements of interorbital width (in mm) in 40 domestic pigeons measured to the nearest 0.1 mm

Save a copy [pigeon.txt](data/pigeon.txt)

--

Import the data in to R with `read.table()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pigeon <- read.table("pigeon.txt", header = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon <- read.table("data/pigeon.txt", header = TRUE)
```
--
`header = TRUE` is an argument in the `read.table()` command which indicates that the datafile has a header, _i.e._, the first value in the file is the variable name

--

You should see an object `pigeon` in the Environment window.

# Working with Data: single variable 
## Understanding a dataframe 

A dataframe is made of columns and rows

The columns are the variables; the rows are the observations

--

To refer a column inside a dataframe (a single column data) we need to use the dollar notation: `dataframe$columnname`

--

So to output all of the one column we can use:
```{r}
pigeon$interorbital
```

# Working with Data: single variable 
## Summarising single group data  

R provides many functions to allow you to make calculations on your data.

For example, the mean
```{r}
mean(pigeon$interorbital)
```

--

Which functions will calculate the standard deviation and the number of cases, _i.e._, the length of the column

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Importing 2

This section will teach you about three concepts:

--

1. 'working directories', 'paths' and  'relative paths' 

--

2. dealing with data in more than group  

--

3. the concept of 'tidy' data

--

We will work with the interorbital distances of domestion pigeons in two different populations: A and B

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Importing 2

It is good practice to organise your files into a folder structure. 

For example, I often use:

![a folder called stemcells with 4 subfolders - figures, processed data, raw data and scripts](pics/dir_structure.png)

---
background-image: url(pics/interorbital.png)
background-position: 95% 5%
background-size: 200px

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Importing 2

Make a folder in your working directory called 'data'

You can do this either RStudio  - see the bottom right Files panel

or

in Windows explorer

--

Forgotten where you are? Use
```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

--

Save a copy of [pigeon2.txt](../data/pigeon2.txt) to the 'data' folder

background-image: url(pics/interorbital.png)
background-position: 95% 5%

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Importing

To read the data in to R you need to use the 'relative path' to the file in the `read.table()` command:

```{r}
pigeon2 <- read.table("data/pigeon2.txt", header = TRUE)
```

--

The `data/` part is the 'relative path' to the file. 

--

It says where the file is **relative to your working directory**

pigeon2.txt is inside a folder (directory) called 'data' which is in your working directory.

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Importing

Look at the structure of the dataframe pigeon2 using `str()`

```{r }
str(pigeon2)
```
--

It's a dataframe with two variables (columns) called A and B

The datatype of both variables is numeric.

# Working with Data: two variables 
## Summarising multi-group data

Find the mean for each population. 

Remember, to refer a column inside a dataframe (a single column data) we need to use the dollar notation: `dataframe$columnname`

--

The mean of column $A

```{r }
mean(pigeon2$A)
```

The mean of column $B

```{r }
mean(pigeon2$B)
```

# Working with Data 
## Tidy format

Instead of having a population in each column, we very often have, **and want**, data organised so the measurements are all in one column and a second column gives the group. This format is described as 'tidy'<sup>1</sup>

Tidy data has a variable in each column and only one observation (case) per row.

# Working with Data 
## Tidy format

Tidy data has a variable in each column and only one observation (case) per row.

Suppose we had just 3 individuals in each population:

.pull-left[
**NOT TIDY!**
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(pigeon2[1:3,], 
             format = "html")
```
]
```{r echo=FALSE}
pigeon3 <- gather(data = pigeon2, 
                  key = population, 
                  value = distance)
```

.pull-right[
**TIDY!**
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(pigeon3[c(1:3,41:43),]), 
             format = "html",
             row.names = FALSE)
```

# Working with Data 
## Tidy format

We can make the data tidy with `gather()`<sup>1</sup>.

`gather()` needs 3 arguments:
--

* the dataframe 
--

* a `key` the grouping variable 
--

* a `value` the measurement variable.
--

```{r}

pigeon3 <- gather(data = pigeon2, key = population, value = distance)
str(pigeon3)
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<small>[1] `gather()` is a function from a package called `tidyr` which is one of the `tidyverse` packages</small>

# Working with Data 
## Summarising multi-group data

Now we have a dataframe in tidy format which will make it easier to summarise, analyse and visualise.

How can we summarise now?

--

If we use 
```{r}
mean(pigeon3$distance)
```

We will get the mean of the two populations combined.

--

To get the mean of each population we use `tapply()`.

# Working with Data 
## Summarising multi-group data

`tapply()` takes three arguments:

* the grouping variable

* function to be applied:  

`tapply(measurement, grouping, function)`

Standard errors are given by 

$$s.e. = \frac{s.d.}{\sqrt{n}} $$

--

You will need to
* calculate and assign the standard deviations to variable
* calculate and assign the number of cases to variable
* find out what function finds the squareroot of its argument
* apply what you know about the elementwise way R works

# How do you work?

* What program do you analyse your data in?  


* What program do you plot your data in?  


* What program do you use to write up the results to submit to a journal (or similar)?  


* What is your process for getting your summary data, statistical results, tables and figures in to your report?  


--

* What do you do when you get additional data that increases your sample sizes?  

--

* What do you do if you wrote in Word formated for one journal and now have to submit in PDF formated for another?

--

Typically people analyse, plot and write up in different programs. Graphs are saved to files and copied and pasted into the final report. 

This process relies on manual labour. If the data changes, the author must repeat the entire process to update the report.
